# Information

This project was made by the specifications of The Odin Project's
Full Stack JavaScript curriculum, found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list

While doing this project I got to use all the skills I've been learning about while going through the Odin Project, I especially learned a lot about creating and manipulating DOM elements through JavaScript, using objects and their constructors and making a site that feels somewhat responsive.

I feel that I have become proficient in manipulating the styling and managing the overall layout of the site while doing this project.
